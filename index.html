                    <p>In the 1860s, a beverage made out of wine and coca leaves was marketed around the world as a cure-all: you could take it to stay awake, to increase energy, to alleviate pain and enhance artistic and athletic performance. ‘Vin Mariani’, so named after its creator, a French chemist, was endorsed by popes, drank by celebrities, and enjoyed by millions.
                    <br><br>
                    It contained around 220mg of cocaine per litre. </p>

                Coca plants (<i>Erythroxylum coca</i>) are shrub-like bushes native to western South America.  In the Andes mountains, their leaves have been chewed and ground for energy and pain relief by indigenous people since 8000 B.C.E., typically with the addition of calcite or lime so that the alkaloid it contains may be absorbed. The alkaloid in question: cocaine. 
                <br><br>
                At the time of Vin Mariani's production, no prohibition existed on coca leaves and cocaine. In fact, no prohibition existed for <i>any</i> type of drug, at least not in any way that could be considered comprehensive. So, same as with opium products, cocaine was freely used and beloved:  following its chemical isolation in 1855 it spread across the globe, and began to be added to medicine, drinks, tonics, mood enhancing elixirs, and even foods. Sigmund Freud famously advocated for its use, and it was an ingredient in the original recipe for Coca Cola until 1904.
                <br><br>
                By the turn of the 20th century, some efforts had been made to curb its use, owing in no small part to its association with crimes (real or perceived) committed under its influence by the African American population in the United States. In January 1912, the League of Nations approved the first treaty to establish drug prohibitions at the international level. However, despite multiple ammendments and expanding protocols, it did not see widespread enforcement.
                <br><br>
                By the late 1940s, cocaine manufacture and processing plants in Peru and Bolivia had boomed, with both countries prepared to make the most of the plant's potential and a booming, globalised market. 
                <br><br>
                Then, in 1949, it all came to an end.
