Critical gap: temporal mismatch between immediate economic needs and long-term agricultural development. Alternative crops (coffee, cacao) take 3-5 years to full production. Program provides support for 2 years. Families must survive the intervening period. Only 30% remain in legal crops after 5 years. Failures typically occur in first 2 years during 'waiting period.' Program design assumes debt-free starting point (rarely true). Payment delays exacerbate problem. Insufficient support during critical transition period drives families back to coca."
