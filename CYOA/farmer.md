Node 1. A farmer from the Ene river valley. You own 2 hectares of land. For generations, your family has grown coffee, but you know that coca leaf pays three times as much, and the middlemen come directly to your door. Your neighbour just bought a new truck.

    Choices:
    A. You plant Coca.

        Node 3. You plant coca. A man from the village offers you cash—more than you'd make in six months—for your entire harvest. He says it's for 'traditional use' but you've seen the plastic barrels and chemicals hidden in the nearby valley. You know what those are for.

            Choices:
            A. You agree to sell to the man from the village. 

                Node 5. Dawn breaks and you see trucks approaching. The police eradication team. Your neighbor's field was destroyed last week. You have minutes to decide.
