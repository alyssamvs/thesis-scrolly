courier_start,A,Accept the courier job,courier_airport,"$5,000 represents 2+ years income for low-wage Lima workers. Economic coercion is primary recruitment driver - 70-80% of couriers are women, mostly single mothers.","International drug trafficking: 3-9 years in Spain, 6-15 years in Peru. No legal distinction for economic coercion."
courier_start,B,Refuse and find another way,courier_refuse,"Refusing doesn't guarantee safety. Traffickers use debt bondage and threats. Witness protection is severely underfunded in Peru.","Debt bondage is trafficking under Peru Law 28950, but enforcement is weak. Police corruption documented."
courier_airport,A,Swallow the drug packets,courier_swallow_flight,"Internal transport has lower detection rate (~20-30%) but severe health risks. Packet rupture has 30-40% mortality rate.","If packets rupture: medical emergency, possible death. Hospital arrest is mandatory under Spanish law."
courier_airport,B,Use false-bottom luggage,courier_caught_customs,"X-ray technology detects luggage concealment ~70-80% of cases. Spanish customs arrest ~3,000 couriers annually at Madrid.","Detection is highly probable. Conviction rate >95%. Spain: 3-9 years, no mule defense."
courier_airport,C,Back out at the last moment,courier_backout_retaliation,"Backing out creates 'debt' from wasted expenses. Trafficking organizations use violence and coercion to force compliance.","Organizations retaliate against refusals. Debt bondage and threats are common. Limited police protection."
courier_swallow_flight,A,Tell flight crew you need help,courier_rupture_arrest,"Emergency medical intervention can save your life but means certain arrest. Spanish hospitals must report suspected couriers.","Medical treatment is mandatory. Arrest in hospital. Spain: 3-9 years for 500g trafficking."
courier_swallow_flight,B,Stay quiet and hope to survive,courier_successful_trapped,"If you survive, you get paid. But the first trip traps you - organizations force repeat trips through threats and debt.","Successful couriers are coerced into multiple trips. Average: 10+ runs before arrest. No real exit."
courier_refuse,A,Report recruitment to police,courier_police_limited_help,"Witness protection exists in law but is underfunded. Protection typically reserved for high-level cases, not recruitment attempts.","Peru Law 27378 protection rarely available for low-level cases. Police corruption in drug cases documented."
courier_refuse,B,Accept the debt consequences,courier_economic_desperation,"'Debt' grows through interest. Organizations use economic pressure to force eventual participation. Many eventually become couriers anyway.","Debt bondage is trafficking but rarely prosecuted. Economic desperation drives eventual participation."
