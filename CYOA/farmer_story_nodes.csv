farmer_start,Farmer,Cultivation,"You are a farmer from the Ene river valley in Peru. You own 2 hectares of land. For generations, your family has grown coffee, but you know that coca leaf pays three times as much, and the middlemen come directly to your door. Your neighbor just bought a new truck.",farm_ene_valley,"Traditional coca cultivation is constitutionally protected in Peru (Article 89), but cultivation for cocaine production is illegal and subject to eradication programs. Coca prices: $2-4/kg vs coffee $1.50/kg. Economic pressure drives approximately 60% of farmers in coca-growing regions toward coca cultivation.","Peru,Bolivia,Colombia","Ene River Valley, VRAEM region, Peru","Peru Constitution 1993 Art. 89; UNODC World Drug Report 2023; DEVIDA Agricultural Income Data 2022",Initial decision point - coca or coffee
farmer_coca_01,Farmer,Production,"You plant coca. A man from the village offers you cash—more than you'd make in six months—for your entire harvest. He says it's for 'traditional use' but you've seen the plastic barrels and chemicals hidden in the nearby valley. You know what those are for.",coca_middleman,"Selling coca leaf to cocaine producers is prosecuted as drug trafficking in Peru. Penalties: 8-15 years minimum for production-related offenses (Article 296). Approximately 75% of coca in Peru enters cocaine production chains. Farmers create plausible deniability by selling to intermediaries, but legal liability remains.","Peru,Colombia,Bolivia","Ene River Valley, Peru","Peru Penal Code Article 296; UNODC Peru Country Profile 2023; Peru Judiciary Sentencing Data",COCA PATH - middleman offer decision

You have minutes to decide what to do about your coca crop.",eradication_trucks,"Peru's CORAH (Special Project for Control and Reduction of Coca Cultivation in Alto Huallaga) destroyed 25,486 hectares in 2022. Eradication is military-led and often violent: 47 deaths in eradication confrontations 2010-2020. Bolivia under Morales prohibited forced eradication (Law 1008 reforms), allowing community-controlled coca monitoring instead. Colombia combines forced eradication with voluntary substitution but violence persists.","Peru,Bolivia,Colombia","Ene River Valley, Peru","UNODC Coca Cultivation Report 2023; CORAH Annual Reports; Defensoría del Pueblo Peru 2022; Bolivia Law 1008",COCA-SELL PATH - eradication confrontation

Coca farmers: $400-600/month ($4,800-7,200 annually). Coffee production costs often exceed revenues at current market prices. Alternative development programs provide $1,000-2,000 over 2 years—insufficient for long-term economic sustainability.

farmer_coffee_loan_02,Farmer,Cultivation,"You take a loan from a local lender—50% interest. It's the only option. Now you're farming not for profit but to service debt. The coca middlemen still come by weekly. Their offers sound better each time.",farm_debt,"Rural debt in coca-growing regions creates acute vulnerability to trafficking. Predatory lending is common where formal banking is absent: interest rates 40-100% annually. Approximately 40% of legal-crop farmers take informal loans. Studies show 55% of farmers who take loans switch to coca cultivation within 3 years. Debt is the primary driver of coca adoption after attempted legal crops. Informal lenders sometimes use intimidation; state provides limited protection or debt relief.","Peru,Colombia,Bolivia","Ene River Valley, Peru","Rural Finance Studies Peru 2022; UNODC Farmer Surveys 2023; Defensoría del Pueblo Rural Credit Report",COFFEE-LOAN PATH - debt trap
