farmer_start,A,Plant coca for higher income,farmer_coca_01,risk,+2,"Economic pressure drives many farmers to coca despite legal risks. Coca leaf prices in Peru: $2-4/kg vs coffee $1.50/kg. Average coca farmer income: $400-600/month vs coffee farmer $150-200/month. Approximately 60% of farmers in coca-growing regions cultivate coca. This represents a rational economic choice in the face of poverty, though it carries significant legal risk.","Coca cultivation linked to cocaine production: 8-15 years minimum penalty in Peru (Article 296)"
farmer_start,B,Stick with legal coffee,farmer_coffee_01,economic,+3,"Legal agriculture provides stability but severe economic hardship. Coffee farmers in Peru earn approximately $150-200/month average—below poverty line for rural families. Global coffee prices have stagnated while production costs increase. This 'legal choice' often means inadequate nutrition, inability to afford children's education, and grinding poverty. Many farmers who choose coffee initially switch to coca within 3-5 years due to unsustainable economics.","Legal but economically precarious - shows why many farmers feel they have no real choice"
farmer_coca_01,A,Sell to the middleman,farmer_coca_sell_02,risk,+3,"Most coca farmers (estimated 75%) sell to intermediaries without direct processing involvement. This creates plausible deniability but is still prosecutable as drug trafficking under Peru Penal Code Article 296. Farmers typically don't know final destination but can infer cocaine production. Intermediaries pay cash immediately, creating economic dependency. Once you sell the first harvest, repeated transactions become normalized.","In Peru, selling coca for cocaine production = drug trafficking (8-15 years minimum). No legal distinction between farmer and trafficker in sentencing."
farmer_coca_01,B,Get ENACO permits for legal coca,farmer_coca_permits_end,knowledge,+3,"ENACO (Empresa Nacional de la Coca) holds state monopoly on legal coca sales in Peru. Traditional coca use for chewing (chacchar) is constitutionally protected. However: permits are difficult to obtain, require extensive documentation, involve long bureaucratic delays, and ENACO purchase prices are lower than black market. Legal cultivation areas are geographically limited. Bolivia's model is more permissive, allowing 22,000 hectares of legal coca (Law 1008). Peru's restrictive ENACO system pushes farmers toward illegal market.","Legal coca possible but restrictive. Bolivia allows 22,000 hectares community-controlled legal coca. Peru's ENACO system is bureaucratic and pays below market rates."
farmer_coca_01,C,Report the cocaine lab to authorities,farmer_coca_report_end,moral,+5,"Cooperation with authorities is extremely rare: estimated <15% of farmers report suspicious activity. Reasons: (1) Fear of retaliation from criminal organizations—witness intimidation and killings documented; (2) Weak witness protection—Peru's program protects ~200 witnesses annually, mostly urban, minimal rural capacity; (3) Distrust of corrupt officials—police collaboration with traffickers documented in VRAEM region; (4) No economic alternative—reporting doesn't provide income replacement; (5) Community pressure—'snitching' carries social costs.","Peru witness protection: limited reach in rural areas (~200 protected annually). Retaliation risk is real. Alternative development rarely accompanies cooperation."
farmer_coca_sell_02,A,Hide the coca crop from eradication,farmer_coca_sell_hide_end,risk,+4,"Evasion is common but increasingly difficult. CORAH uses satellite imagery, GPS mapping, and aerial surveillance to identify coca fields. Estimated 30% of farmers attempt evasion when eradication teams approach. Tactics: covering plants with tarps, planting in dispersed small plots, using tree cover. Success rate declining as technology improves. If caught evading, adds 'obstruction of justice' to charges. Some farmers successfully hide crops temporarily but eradication teams often return.","CORAH uses satellite and GPS technology; evasion success rate declining. Being caught hiding can add charges and increase sentence."
farmer_coca_sell_02,B,Accept eradication peacefully,farmer_coca_sell_accept_end,risk,+1,"Voluntary acceptance sometimes leads to alternative development program enrollment. DEVIDA (Peru's anti-drug agency) offers: $1,000-2,000 compensation over 2 years, technical assistance for alternative crops, some market access support. However: compensation rarely equals lost coca income ($3,000-5,000/hectare annually), payments often delayed 6-12 months, long-term success rate low (~30% remain in legal crops after 5 years). Accepting eradication means immediate economic crisis for family. Bolivia's community coca monitoring eliminates forced eradication entirely.","Compensation in Peru: $1,000-2,000 over 2 years vs coca income $3,000-5,000 annually. Payments often delayed. Bolivia eliminated forced eradication via community monitoring."
farmer_coca_sell_02,C,Resist the eradication team,farmer_coca_sell_resist_end,risk,+8,"Armed resistance to eradication has occurred, especially in Peru's VRAEM (Valley of the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro Rivers) region where Shining Path remnants remain active. EXTREMELY DANGEROUS: 47 deaths in eradication confrontations 2010-2020 (both farmers and police). Resistance transforms legal status: adds charges of assaulting public officials, terrorism (if organized), murder (if casualties). Military uses lethal force. Some farmers feel trapped with no alternative but to defend livelihood. Colombia and Peru both report eradication violence; Bolivia's elimination of forced eradication removed this flashpoint entirely.","Violence in eradication: 47 deaths 2010-2020 in Peru. Armed resistance adds terrorism and assault charges, transforming farmer into combatant in eyes of law. Military has firepower advantage."
farmer_coffee_01,A,Take a high-interest loan to survive,farmer_coffee_loan_02,economic,+3,"Predatory lending is common in rural areas without formal banking access. Interest rates: 40-100% annually from informal lenders. Approximately 40% of legal-crop farmers take such loans when facing economic crisis. Farmers use loans for: children's education, medical emergencies, farm inputs, basic family consumption. Loan quickly becomes unpayable at these rates. Informal lenders have no regulation; some use threats/intimidation for repayment. State provides almost no protection. This debt is the primary driver of eventual coca adoption: studies show 55% of loan-taking farmers switch to coca within 3 years.","Rural debt trap: 40-100% interest rates common. No state protection from predatory lending. Debt is primary driver of coca adoption—55% of loan-takers switch to coca within 3 years."
farmer_coffee_01,B,Try to organize a coffee cooperative,farmer_coffee_coop_end,knowledge,+2,"Cooperative organization can improve farmer bargaining power and market access. Peru has numerous coffee cooperatives (e.g., Cooperativa Cafetalera Valle de Incahuasi). Benefits: collective bargaining, shared equipment, direct export channels, fair trade certification access. However: requires significant capital investment, strong social cohesion, leadership capacity, years to establish market relationships. Success rate: approximately 30% of organized cooperatives remain economically viable after 5 years. Challenges: lack of capital, competition from subsidized imports, internal conflicts, external market volatility. Cooperatives work better in regions with strong existing social organization.","Cooperatives can improve bargaining power but require capital, time, and social cohesion. Success rate ~30% after 5 years. Faces challenges: capital access, market competition, leadership."
farmer_coffee_01,C,Migrate to the city for work,farmer_coffee_migrate_end,economic,+1,"Rural-urban migration is common when legal agriculture fails economically. Approximately 25% of rural farmers in coca-growing regions migrate to cities (primarily Lima, Ayacucho, Cusco). Migration consequences: (1) Land loss—fields abandoned or sold cheaply; (2) Informal urban employment—construction, street vending, domestic work; (3) Loss of agricultural skills and identity; (4) Urban poverty—slums, inadequate services; (5) Family separation—often men migrate first; (6) No return path—difficult to reclaim agricultural livelihood once departed. Migration is escape from immediate economic pressure but not path to prosperity.","~25% of rural farmers migrate when legal agriculture fails. Urban employment usually informal/unstable. Migration means losing land and agricultural livelihood—often irreversible."
farmer_coffee_loan_02,A,Switch to coca to pay off debt,farmer_coca_01,risk,+4,"Debt is the PRIMARY driver of coca adoption after attempted legal crops. Studies show 55% of farmers who take loans for legal agriculture switch to coca cultivation within 3 years—the economic math becomes unavoidable. A farmer with $2,000 debt at 50% interest owes $3,000 after one year; coffee income cannot service this debt. Coca provides the only path to debt repayment and family survival. You are now caught between loan sharks demanding payment and law enforcement prosecuting coca cultivation. This is the economic trap that creates the cocaine supply chain—it's not moral failing but mathematical inevitability given the economic structure.","Debt-driven coca cultivation: caught between loan shark demands and law enforcement. 55% of loan-taking farmers switch to coca within 3 years. Economic trap, not moral failing."
farmer_coffee_loan_02,B,Default on loan and face consequences,farmer_coffee_loan_default_end,economic,+2,"Default on informal loans can result in: (1) Land seizure by lender—often through intimidation rather than legal process; (2) Community shame and social exclusion; (3) Physical threats from lenders or their associates; (4) Loss of future credit access; (5) Family pressure and conflict. State provides minimal protection: informal lending is unregulated, police rarely intervene in debt disputes, courts favor documented lenders. Some farmers default and lose everything; others face ongoing harassment. Default means losing land that has been in family for generations, becoming landless laborer or forced urban migrant. Harsh consequences with limited legal recourse.","Informal debt default: land seizure, community shame, physical threats, no state protection. Informal lenders use intimidation. Often means losing family land of generations."
farmer_coffee_loan_02,C,Seek help from alternative development program,farmer_coffee_loan_altdev_end,moral,+2,"Alternative development programs exist but rarely address existing debt—major structural flaw. DEVIDA programs provide: technical assistance, some inputs for new crops, market linkage support. However: (1) No debt relief component—programs assume debt-free starting point; (2) Wait times 6-12 months for enrollment; (3) Support insufficient ($1,000-2,000 over 2 years); (4) Income from alternative crops takes years to materialize; (5) Market access for new crops uncertain. This temporal mismatch—immediate debt vs. long-term crop development—means programs often fail to prevent coca adoption. Only ~30-40% of participants remain in legal crops after 5 years. Programs address future income but not present debt crisis.","Alternative development: provides future crop support but NOT debt relief. 6-12 month wait times. Income takes years to materialize. Only 30-40% remain in legal crops after 5 years. Temporal mismatch: immediate debt vs. long-term support."
