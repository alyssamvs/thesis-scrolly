courier_start,Courier,Recruitment,"You lost your factory job three months ago. Rent is overdue, your daughter needs medicine you can't afford. A woman approaches you in the market - professional, friendly. She offers you $5,000 to fly to Madrid and bring back a package. 'It's safe,' she says. 'Hundreds do it every month. Just one trip.' Your daughter coughs in the background. You have $12 in your pocket. What do you do?",lima_market,"Peru-Spain is major cocaine corridor to Europe. Estimated 60-70% of European cocaine enters through Spain. Couriers are overwhelmingly women (70-80%) from poor backgrounds, often single mothers. Average age: 25-35. Economic desperation is primary recruitment driver. Payment of $5,000 represents 2+ years income for low-wage workers in Lima.","Peru,Spain,Colombia","Lima, Peru - Poor neighborhood","UNODC World Drug Report 2023; Spanish Ministry of Interior arrest statistics 2022; Peru INEI poverty data 2022",START - Economic desperation
courier_airport,Courier,Transport Decision,"You're at Jorge Chávez Airport. The recruiter hands you a ticket to Madrid and presents your options: (1) Swallow latex packets filled with cocaine - lower detection rate but health risk if they rupture. (2) Hide packets in false-bottom luggage - safer for you but higher detection rate. (3) You can still walk away - but they know where you live, where your mother lives, where your daughter goes to school.",airport_lima,"Transport methods: Internal (swallowing) has ~20-30% detection rate but 30-40% mortality if rupture. External (luggage) has ~70-80% detection rate with X-ray technology. Spanish customs at Madrid-Barajas arrest ~3,000 couriers annually. Detection technology improving: body scanners, X-ray, drug dogs, behavioral analysis.","Spain,Peru,Ecuador","Jorge Chávez Airport, Lima","Spanish National Police statistics 2022; Journal of Forensic Sciences on packet rupture mortality; UNODC trafficking data",TRANSPORT - Method decision
courier_swallow_flight,Courier,Health Crisis,"You swallowed 50 latex packets. Each contains 10g of cocaine. Total: 500g in your stomach. The flight to Madrid is 12 hours. Six hours in, you feel intense stabbing pain in your abdomen. The packets might be rupturing. If cocaine enters your bloodstream, you could die within minutes - seizures, cardiac arrest, brain hemorrhage. You could tell the flight crew and get emergency help, but that means certain arrest. Or stay quiet and gamble you'll survive until Madrid.",in_flight,"Packet rupture is medical emergency with high mortality. Even with immediate intervention, death is common. Symptoms: severe abdominal pain, seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, hyperthermia. Cocaine overdose via rupture: estimated 30-40% fatality rate. Many deaths unreported - passengers 'die of natural causes' on flights. Hospitals must report suspected drug couriers to police under Spanish law.","Spain,Peru,Netherlands","Flight to Madrid - In the air","Journal of Emergency Medicine case studies; Spanish hospital reporting requirements; Forensic Science International",SWALLOW PATH - Life or death
courier_refuse,Courier,Consequences,"You refused the job. The recruiter's expression hardens. She explains you already spent their 'advance' money - $200 for 'expenses.' You now owe them. You have options: report to police (though police corruption in drug cases is documented in your neighborhood), or accept the debt and its consequences. The debt will grow. They will return.",lima_apartment,"Debt bondage is recognized as human trafficking under UN Palermo Protocol and Peru Law 28950. However, enforcement is weak. Police corruption in drug cases is documented. Witness protection exists in law (Law 27378) but is severely underfunded - typically reserved for high-level cases. Women who refuse courier jobs often face threats, violence, or forced participation later.","Peru,Colombia,Spain","Lima, Peru - Your apartment","UN Palermo Protocol; Peru Law 28950 (Anti-Trafficking); Peru Law 27378 (Witness Protection); UNODC trafficking reports",REFUSE PATH - No safe exit
